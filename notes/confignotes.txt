1/8/11, puppet notes on os x

* puppet user, group are required to run
* /var/lib/puppet should be owned by puppet:puppet
* clean contents of /etc/puppet/ssl if master can't start due to cert mismatches
** can probably clean just the cert in question, but it seems necessary to purge the whole thing when the master gets messed up
